## Lineup Apps

Apps that will create softball lineups automatically!


###Road map
MVP (skateboard):
- Fully working backend where a team can be created (and players added) and it creates a lineup

MVP 2 (scooter):
- Add a database (probably Mongo) and make it a CRUD system (i.e creating new player, editing the info for each player, deleting a player)

MVP 3 (bike):
- Add responsive UI
- Deploy to Heroku

###Technologies used:
- Javascript ES6
- Express
- Grunt

Testing:
- Mocha and Chai
