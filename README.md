###How to run the app

###Road map
MVP (skateboard):
- Fully working backend where a team can be created (and players added) and it creates a lineup

MVP 2 (scooter):
- Add a database (probably Mongo) and make it a CRUD system (i.e creating new player, editing the info for each player, deleting a player)
- Handle errors

MVP 3 (bike):
- Add responsive UI
- Deploy to Heroku

MVP 4 (car):
- Allow different types of softball (by default it's slowpitch but should allow fastpitch)
